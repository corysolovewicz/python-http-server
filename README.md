## Currently the images server is only setup to run under https so you'll need to setup certs before starting

## How to run HTTPS images server
### first generate certificates
### You can either:
### 1) create a self signed certificate
`openssl req -new -x509 -keyout key.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes`

### Or 2) generate one with letsencrypt certbot
```
# install certbot (ubuntu)
apt-get install certbot

# install certbot (centos)
yum install certbot python3-certbot-apache epel-release

# run certonly option
certbot certonly
```
```

### Now start your server using letsencrypt cert
`python3 https_images_server.py 0.0.0.0 443 "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem" "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem"
`

### test that the server is running by going to
`https://example.com/image/IMG_1234.png`
### You should be able to the output from std output
```

### And there should be an image which is loaded
![This is the sample image which is included](/images/IMG_1234.png)

### run https_images_server.py in the background and log to file named https_images.log
#### run in screen session so that we don't have to keep a terminal window open
`screen`

### start server in screen
### start https server on port 443 in screen writing to stdout and writing to log using tee
`python3 https_images server.py 0.0.0.0 443 /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem 2>&1 | tee -a https.log`


### disconnect from screen
`CTRL-A CTRL-D`


# Misc Notes: 
### exiftool command to remove extra exifdata for privacy purposes for an entire directory of image files
`exiftool -all:all= -overwrite_original -r <directory>`

### if you want to fingerprint the browsers of the users you will need
### to create an account and API Key for FingerPrint JS
### and add it to ./spoof/js/fingerprintjs.js
`https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/signup`

### if all you want to do is create iOS screenshots you can simply run this command after checking out the repo
`./spoof/iMessage_1.sh <filename>`
### ignore the following warning as I'm not sure how to get rid of it passing `-q` didn't seem to quiet it
```
Warning: [minor] Text/EXIF chunk(s) found after PNG IDAT (fixed) - ./images/<filename>
```
### You can find your newly created image in `<project root>/images/<filename>`
